        <h3>5.1 Testing and Debugging:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unit Testing:</strong> Each servo was tested individually for angle range response</li>
            <li><strong>Integration Testing:</strong> Complete control system was evaluated using Processing GUI</li>
            <li><strong>Debugging:</strong> Resolved overheating issues, ensured correct angle parsing, verified PWM signals</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.2 Evaluation:</h3>
        <p>The system meets its goal of safely controlling servos remotely. Arduino code reliability and user interface responsiveness were confirmed. Though the physical structure wasn't printed, the electronic control system is functional and works. I can confidentially say that if the robotic arm was modelled, this would have 100% worked in picking up my 30 mL beaker.</p>

        <p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Add printed housing, Add a LCD display to show what angle each joint is at, Add a text box on the side to manually type in desired angle between 0-180.</p>
